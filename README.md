# PROGRESS WIP ~ (Do more soon)
MAKE COPIEs ~ Of the "pricewise" project, (As it is, at this point in time) - (Uploaded **HERE** today)

THE YT-VID-INSTRUCTION ~ [VID-Count == Approx 21:35 == WHERE I might resume now()]

now() == 5:15AM TUESDAY 2nd JANUARY 2023

MY VERSION OF LINUX ~ [Refused to install Nodejs (Vanilla Version), like shown in the video]
Xubuntu version == 20.04 LTS

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04
Option 1 — Installing Node.js with Apt from the Default Repositories

AND ~ Perform, a number of other backward summer-sults, just to get the "web-dev-environment" running.
Just like the YT-Video, if you know what I mean, (Maybe Not).


THE INSTALL DETAILs ~ (As shown by digital ocean)

    sudo apt update

Then install Node.js:

    sudo apt install nodejs

Check that the install was successful by querying node for its version number:

    node -v

Output
v10.19.0

THAT ABOVE ~ (Just a little bit out-dated, but provided the correct install cli-cmd details below)

test@xz97:~$ node -v
<br /> v20.10.0


If the package in the repositories suits your needs, this is all you need to do to get set up with Node.js. In most cases, you’ll also want to also install npm, the Node.js package manager. You can do this by installing the npm package with apt:

    sudo apt install npm
